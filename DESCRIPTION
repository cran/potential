Description: Provides functions to compute the potential model as defined by
    Stewart (1941) <doi:10.1126/science.93.2404.89>. Several options are available
    to customize the model, such as the possibility to fine-tune the distance
    friction functions or to use custom distance matrices. Some computations are
    parallelized to improve their efficiency.
